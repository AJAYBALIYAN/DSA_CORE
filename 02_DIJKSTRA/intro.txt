Dijksatra

-> to find the shortest distance of all the nodes from the source.
-> it can also be implemented by priority queue and sets.
-> fails with negative weight edges as the distance will always be reduced in adding -ve weight to it(bellman)
-> sets O(V^2) it can be optimized to O(E*logV) by PQ.
